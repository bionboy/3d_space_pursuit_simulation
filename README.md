## A 3D space battle simulation using Babylon.js

## Task:
- Write a Simulation program and test it for a 3-Dimensional space pursuit of two spaceships each equipped with a laser beam weapon that can destroy its target if it is within a cylindrical angle (α) of degrees and a distance of ß.
- Do  not  assume  a  pure  pursuit,  but  make  any  necessary  assumptions  for  smart  spaceship commanders. 
- Some  sort  of  graphic  (character  graphic  is  allowed) output  is  required  in  addition  to  a  summary  report discussing your results
